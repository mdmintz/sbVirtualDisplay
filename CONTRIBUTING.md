## (A Note on Style Guide Rules)

[flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) is the law of the land. The only flake8 rule ignored is [W503](https://github.com/grantmcconnaughey/Flake8Rules/blob/master/_rules/W503.md). For more details on why W503 should be ignored, see [this explanation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator), or [this shorter explanation](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/494) by Python expert [Anthony Sottile](https://github.com/asottile).
